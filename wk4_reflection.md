This week for Something Awesome I was planning to work on function tracing and function hooking. I was unfortunately not able to stick to this plan.

Halfway through the week I got feedback on the proposal, along with the request to include that I would do comprehensive write-ups of each section I did work on. This was fine, but the issue was then that I hadn't done that for last week's stuff (loading a module, hello world, etc). Because of this, I had to do this this week.

As I was writing it I found it was actually making me learn it in better detail than I had the week before, and was equally good revision for me. Because of this, I spent about 3 hours pulling together resources and information so I could create a pretty comprehensive explanation for what I'd done and why it was working.

This was really useful - I have a super solid foundation to go off of moving forwards now, and I found my document a bit easier to quickly read than the book I'm also using as a reference, so I'm glad I did it.

The downside is that I didn't have time to go through and finish up to my credit grade, like planned, though. My plan to recover from this is to spend a few hours extra on what I usually would next weekend + throughout flexibility week to catch up on this.
